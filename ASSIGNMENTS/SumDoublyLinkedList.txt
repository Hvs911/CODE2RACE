Sum of all nodes in a doubly linked list divisible by a given number K
Given a doubly linked list containing N nodes and given a number K. The task is to find the sum of all such nodes which are divisible by K.

Examples:

Input: List = 15 <=> 16 <=> 10 <=> 9 <=> 6 <=> 7 <=> 17
       K = 3
Output: Sum = 30

Input: List = 5 <=> 3 <=> 6 <=> 8 <=> 4 <=> 1 <=> 2 <=> 9
       K = 2
Output: Sum = 20
Approach: The idea is to traverse the doubly linked list and check the nodes one by one. If a nodeâ€™s value is divisible by K then add that node value to sum otherwise continue this process while the end of the list is not reached.

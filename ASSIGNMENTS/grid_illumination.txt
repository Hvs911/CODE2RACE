# Grid Illumination: You are given an empty NxN grid and an array
# of lamp coordinates. Each lamp provides illumination to every
# square in their row, every square in their column, and every
# square that lies in their diagonal (aka chess Queen). Given an
# array of query coordinates, determine whether that point is
# illuminated or not. The catch is that when checking a query
# all lamps adjacent to, or on, that query get turned off.
# The ranges for the variables/arrays were about:
# 10^3 < N < 10^9, 10^3 < lamps < 10^9, 10^3 < queries < 10^9.
